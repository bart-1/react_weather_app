## About

This app presents weather conditions for concrete localization. You can choose what should be presented by some ready buttons (now it is three places in Poland) or type country (with searching module) and put city name. If weather data exist is downloaded and presented. Data is downloaded from OpenWeather  thru my API service with some middleware (https://github.com/bart-1/weather-api).
